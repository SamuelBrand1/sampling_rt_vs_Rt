  \caption{Directed graph representing the generative model components. Shown are model choices we experiment over in this study (green rectangles), the observation model (which is fixed in this study; blue rectangle), and generated quantities (red boxes). The generated quantities are split between a primary transmission intensity measure $T(t)$ which composes with the infection-generating process to generate latent infections, and secondary transmission intensity measures.  All transmission intensity measures are targets for surveillance. Each modelled quantity can be constructed conditional on parent quantities on the graph (directed edges).  }
